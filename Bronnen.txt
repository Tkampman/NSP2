abstract = {The east–west asymmetry of the cosmic muon flux has been measured in Hanoi where the geomagnetic rigidity cut-off reaches its maximal value of 17 GV. The measurement was made using an orientable scintillator telescope that had been previously used to measure the zenith angle distribution of the cosmic muon flux in the direction of the geographic north. The data exhibit a clear east–west asymmetry in good agreement with the predictions of a model widely used in the analysis of atmospheric neutrino oscillation studies.}
